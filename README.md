# Introduction to R for Data Science (FutureLearn)

By Graeme West

This notebook covers the material in Week 1 of [Introduction to R for
Data Science](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/data-science/5) by
Purdue University on FutureLearn.

This repository is intended to serve as a record of my learning, and my
solutions to the various challenges set by the instructors.

The subject matter of the data is airline flight data from the United
States.

The original dataset for week 1 is too large to store on GitHub, so
here’s a handy R snippet that will download it for
you:

``` r
download.file("http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/2008.csv.bz2",destfile="datasets/2008.csv.bz2",method="libcurl")
```
