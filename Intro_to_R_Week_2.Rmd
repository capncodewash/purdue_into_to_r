This notebook covers the material in Week 2 of [Introduction to R for Data Science](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/data-science/5) by Purdue University on FutureLearn.

The subject matter of the data is airline flight data from the United States. Week 1 covers basic setup, exploratory data analysis, selecting data, and basic plotting.

## Preparatory steps

Read in the basic 2008 data (this takes a couple of minutes):
```{r}
myDF <- read.csv("./datasets/2008.csv.bz2")
```
